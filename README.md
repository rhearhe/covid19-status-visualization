The scope of the project is to visualize and analyse Covid-19 data to better understand 
its metrics, its occurrence in various parts of the world, number of positive cases, 
number of deaths and various other factors in order to derive significant conclusions 
from it. 
This interactive dashboard visualizes the worldwide status and the status of India due to COVID 19.

A dot map is used to visualise the number of positive cases in the various states of India.
The size of the dot determines how high the positivity rate is in that particular state.
